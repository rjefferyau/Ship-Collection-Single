- **Effort**: Medium-High

**9. API Integration Testing**
- **Issue**: Limited integration testing for API endpoints
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive API testing with test database
- **Impact**: Better API reliability and error detection
- **Effort**: Medium

### User Experience Enhancements

**10. Advanced Search and Filtering**
- **Current**: Basic search functionality
- **Enhancement**: Add advanced filters, saved searches, and search history
- **Impact**: Improved user productivity and collection management
- **Effort**: Medium-High

**11. Mobile Responsiveness Improvements**
- **Issue**: Some components not fully optimized for mobile devices
- **Solution**: Comprehensive mobile UI/UX review and improvements
- **Impact**: Better mobile user experience
- **Effort**: Medium

**12. Accessibility Compliance**
- **Issue**: Limited accessibility features
- **Solution**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Impact**: Better accessibility for all users
- **Effort**: Medium

## Low Priority Items

### Feature Enhancements

**13. Data Export/Import Improvements**
- **Current**: Basic CSV import functionality
- **Enhancement**: Excel export, multiple import formats, data validation
- **Impact**: Better data management capabilities
- **Effort**: Medium

**14. Advanced Reporting Dashboard**
- **Current**: Basic statistics display
- **Enhancement**: Interactive charts, trend analysis, custom reports
- **Impact**: Better collection insights and analytics
- **Effort**: High

**15. User Management System**
- **Current**: Single-user application
- **Future**: Multi-user support with authentication and authorization
- **Impact**: Scalability for multiple users
- **Effort**: Very High
- **Note**: See [Multi-Tenant Specification](./multi-tenant-specification.md) for detailed implementation plan

### Infrastructure & Deployment

**16. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
- **Current**: Manual deployment process
- **Enhancement**: Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Impact**: Better development workflow and deployment reliability
- **Effort**: Medium

**17. Environment Configuration Management**
- **Issue**: Manual environment setup
- **Solution**: Docker Compose improvements and environment templates
- **Impact**: Easier development setup and deployment
- **Effort**: Low-Medium

**18. Database Migration Framework**
- **Current**: Manual migration scripts
- **Enhancement**: Automated migration system with version control
- **Impact**: Better database change management
- **Effort**: Medium

## Long-term Strategic Projects

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Migration

**21. Multi-User Application Platform**
- **Scope**: Complete architectural transformation to support multiple users
- **Timeline**: 6-month dedicated project (12+ months from current date)
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of high/medium priority items (performance, testing, mobile)
- **Approach**: Repository fork strategy to preserve current stable version
- **Components**:
  - Database separation (master catalog vs user collections)
  - Authentication system (NextAuth.js implementation)
  - Role-based access control (admin vs user permissions)
  - User management interface
  - Personal collection management
- **Resource Requirements**: 80% development focus for duration
- **Risk Level**: High - Major architectural change
- **Documentation**: See [Multi-Tenant Specification](./multi-tenant-specification.md) and [Repository Strategy](../REPOSITORY_STRATEGY.md)
- **Business Impact**: Platform scalability, potential monetization opportunities
- **Dependencies**: Market validation, resource allocation, completion of current roadmap

## Dependencies and Considerations

### Technology Stack Updates

**19. Next.js and React Updates**
- **Current**: Next.js 15.4.1 with React 18
- **Consideration**: Regular updates for security and performance
- **Frequency**: Quarterly review
- **Effort**: Low-Medium per update

**20. Database Technology Evaluation**
- **Current**: MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Consideration**: Evaluate alternatives like PostgreSQL for complex queries
- **Timeline**: Long-term consideration
- **Effort**: Very High (if migration needed)
